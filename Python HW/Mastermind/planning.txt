# This is the planning for the game called mastermind
"""
The code maker will choose a combination using the code pegs and hide it
The player will then place 4 code pegs onto the row of the decoding board
The code maker will then compare the player guess and the secret combination
If the player guess is the same as secret combination
    Player wins
    Gameover
Else the code maker will place down the key pegs
    Code maker will then count how many codepeg is the correct color and correct position
        The code maker will then place that amount of black pegs
    Code maker will then count how many codepeg is the correct color and wrong position
        The code maker will then place that amount of white pegs
This will keep going until:
- The player runs of out of guess
- The player guess correctly

"""
### The game part ###
There is 6 color code pegs namely Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Purple
There is 2 color key pegs namely the black pegs and white pegs
There is 8 guesses the player can make

### Functions for the game ###
def place_keys(secret, guess)
    for each


# Beginning of round
The player steps up to the table
Computer make a secret combination length of 4 using the 6 color code pegs (Say RGBB)
While the player is not out of lives
    The player will enter a code using the code pegs
    The computer will then check first if the user code is valid
    If the code is invalid
        The computer will ask the player to re-input the code

    Assuming the code is valid
    The computer will then compare the player code and secret code
    The com will count how many code pegs is in the correct position AND correct color
        The com will then place that amount of black pegs onto the peg row
    The com will count how many code pegs is in the wrong position AND correct color
        The com will then place that amount of black pegs onto the peg row

    If there is 4 black pegs on the latest guess row
        Player wins
        GAMEOVER
    Else:
        The player loses 1 lives
        The computer moves onto the next guess
